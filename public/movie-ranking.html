<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Gorgeous visuals. A beautiful soundtrack. A stunning animated man.</p>

<p>Honestly any Ghibli movie gets my vote, but Howl's Moving Castle is a firm favourite.</p>
<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>I've only watched it once because it made me bawl my eyes out. I can count on one hand the number of movies that have made me cry, so that's quite the feat.</p>

<h3>School of Rock</h3>
<p>My ultimate comfort movie. So wholesome and quotable.</p>

Honestly I am more of a TV girlie, so give me a shout if you have any movie recommendations!
